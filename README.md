Actualy i used 3.5 vitis AI instead of 3.0, the folder contains script to run quantization and also contains compiled blocks for ultra96v2 fpga. 

To compile the blocks 
```
./qt_and_compile_sh
```
To Comile for other fpga boards change arch.json file accordingly.  
Log file contains logs of compilation process.
